# Twitter_Image_Scraper.py

# Description
The Twitter_Image_Scraper program, using the Twitter API, saves media from a users feed to a given directory.
The scraped media is saved to an absolute path on you Desktop, under a double directory of "Twitter_scraped" and "{screen_name}_tweets" 
Its use of the Twitter API may come as an issue for some, it is, nontheless, an issue I seek to remedy in the future!
